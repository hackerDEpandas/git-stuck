# git-stuck
A tool to help make more informed NFL fantasy picks.

The following tool was made possible by the [nflgame API](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nflgame) given by the github user [BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi). 

*vent.py* collects relevant player data (relevant as in, data points that give you points on fanduel) and exports it to a text file.
